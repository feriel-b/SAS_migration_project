# SAS Migration Parsing Validation Test Set

## Overview
This comprehensive test set validates the migration parsing capabilities of `extractor2.py`. It contains 2 SAS files with extensive coverage of all extraction features and edge cases, plus an Excel answer key with expected output.

## Test Coverage

### Core Features Covered
1. **%INCLUDE statements** - Including non-existent file edge case
2. **%LET macro assignments** - Various variable types and values
3. **Macro definitions and calls** - Both simple and multi-line
4. **DATA steps** - Multiple outputs, arrays/loops, merge operations
5. **PROC steps** - All major procedures with output parameters
6. **Database connections** - LIBNAME and PROC SQL connections
7. **Input/output table references** - Various table naming patterns
8. **Error and edge cases** - Missing connections, invalid references

### PROC Steps Included
- **PROC SQL** - CREATE TABLE, INSERT INTO, pass-through queries
- **PROC SORT** - With OUT= parameter
- **PROC MEANS/SUMMARY** - Statistical output datasets
- **PROC FREQ** - Frequency analysis with output
- **PROC TRANSPOSE** - Data restructuring
- **PROC APPEND** - Dataset concatenation
- **PROC DATASETS** - Dataset modification
- **PROC IMPORT/EXPORT** - File I/O operations
- **Statistical PROCs** - UNIVARIATE, CORR, REG, LOGISTIC, GLM, TTEST, NPAR1WAY, MIXED

### Database Engines Tested
- Oracle
- Teradata  
- SQL Server
- Missing/undefined connections

## 10 Specific Edge Cases Implemented

1. **Multi-line macro definitions and calls**
   - `%macro comprehensive_analysis()` spanning multiple lines
   - Multi-line macro calls with parameters

2. **Inline comments and block comments within/between statements**
   - Comments within PROC statements
   - Block comments between procedures
   - Mixed inline and block comment patterns

3. **DATA step with multiple datasets in a single statement**
   - `data work.dataset_a work.dataset_b;`
   - `data work.high_value work.medium_value work.low_value;`

4. **PROC SQL with pass-through and missing connection**
   - Valid: `connect to oracle as ora`
   - Invalid: `connection to missing_conn` (undefined)
   - Invalid: `connection to undefined_db` (not established)

5. **%include with non-existent file**
   - `%include "nonexistent_file.sas";`
   - `%include "shared_utilities.sas";` (also non-existent)

6. **Macro calls embedded in other statements**
   - `data %get_dataset_name();`
   - `data %generate_table_name(prefix=customer, suffix=final);`

7. **PROC IMPORT with macro variable as datafile path**
   - `proc import datafile="&file_path"`
   - `proc import datafile="&import_path"`

8. **DATA step referencing a table from a non-existent libref**
   - `set badlib.nonexistent_table;`
   - `set missinglib.phantom_table;`

9. **PROC step with OUT= using a macro variable**
   - `proc means out=&dataset_name._summary`
   - `proc export outfile="/reports/regional_analysis.&export_format"`

10. **DATA step using arrays and do loops**
    - Array processing with scores and grades
    - Multi-dimensional arrays with iterative processing
    - Conditional logic within loops

## Answer Key Structure

The `final_analysis.xlsx` file contains 72 rows representing the expected output from `extractor2.py`. Each row corresponds to a specific statement or pattern that the extractor should identify.

### Key Columns in Answer Key
- **statement** - The SAS statement being parsed
- **output_table** - Dataset being created (for write-back operations)
- **WRITE_BACK** - "Yes" for operations that create/modify datasets
- **write_back_type** - Type of write operation (DATA_STEP, PROC_SQL_CREATE, etc.)
- **INCLUDE_PATH** - Path for %include statements
- **LET_STATEMENT** - Variable name for %let assignments
- **MACRO_CALL** - Name of macro being called
- **tables_sourcejoin** - Source tables for merge operations
- **DB_CONNECTION** - "Yes" for database connection statements
- **MISSING_CONNECTION** - "Yes" for references to undefined connections
- **file_path** - Source file where statement was found

## Usage Instructions

1. **Run the extractor on test files:**
   ```python
   python extractor2.py
   ```

2. **Compare output with answer key:**
   - Load both the generated output and `final_analysis.xlsx`
   - Compare row counts, column values, and data accuracy
   - Verify all edge cases are properly handled

3. **Validation checklist:**
   - [ ] All %include statements detected with correct dependency status
   - [ ] All %let assignments captured with variable names
   - [ ] All macro calls identified (simple and complex)
   - [ ] All DATA steps marked as write-back operations
   - [ ] All PROC steps with outputs properly categorized
   - [ ] Database connections correctly identified by engine type
   - [ ] Missing connections flagged appropriately
   - [ ] Edge cases handled without errors

## Expected Behavior

The extractor should:
- Parse 72 distinct patterns across both files
- Correctly identify write-back operations (marked with WRITE_BACK=Yes)
- Detect database connections and missing references
- Handle comments without affecting parsing
- Process multi-line constructs properly
- Flag all 10 edge cases appropriately

## Notes

- All syntax follows Base SAS standards
- Files are designed to be syntactically valid but may reference non-existent resources
- The test focuses on parsing accuracy, not execution validity
- Comments are strategically placed to test parsing robustness
