    "\n",
    "6. **Macro calls embedded in other statements**\n",
    "   - `data %get_dataset_name();`\n",

    "\n",
    "10. **DATA step using arrays and do loops**\n",
    "    - Array processing with scores and grades\n",
    "    - Multi-dimensional arrays with iterative processing\n",
    "    - Conditional logic within loops\n",
    "\n",
    "## Answer Key Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The `final_analysis.xlsx` file contains 72 rows representing the expected output from `extractor2.py`. Each row corresponds to a specific statement or pattern that the extractor should identify.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Columns in Answer Key\n",
    "- **statement** - The SAS statement being parsed\n",
    "- **output_table** - Dataset being created (for write-back operations)\n",
    "- **WRITE_BACK** - \"Yes\" for operations that create/modify datasets\n",
    "- **write_back_type** - Type of write operation (DATA_STEP, PROC_SQL_CREATE, etc.)\n",
    "- **INCLUDE_PATH** - Path for %include statements\n",
    "- **LET_STATEMENT** - Variable name for %let assignments\n",
    "- **MACRO_CALL** - Name of macro being called\n",
    "- **tables_sourcejoin** - Source tables for merge operations\n",
    "- **DB_CONNECTION** - \"Yes\" for database connection statements\n",
    "- **MISSING_CONNECTION** - \"Yes\" for references to undefined connections\n",
    "- **file_path** - Source file where statement was found\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Run the extractor on test files:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   python extractor2.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compare output with answer key:**\n",
    "   - Load both the generated output and `final_analysis.xlsx`\n",
    "   - Compare row counts, column values, and data accuracy\n",
    "   - Verify all edge cases are properly handled\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Validation checklist:**\n",
    "   - [ ] All %include statements detected with correct dependency status\n",
    "   - [ ] All %let assignments captured with variable names\n",
    "   - [ ] All macro calls identified (simple and complex)\n",
    "   - [ ] All DATA steps marked as write-back operations\n",
    "   - [ ] All PROC steps with outputs properly categorized\n",
    "   - [ ] Database connections correctly identified by engine type\n",
    "   - [ ] Missing connections flagged appropriately\n",
    "   - [ ] Edge cases handled without errors\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "The extractor should:\n",
    "- Parse 72 distinct patterns across both files\n",
    "- Correctly identify write-back operations (marked with WRITE_BACK=Yes)\n",
    "- Detect database connections and missing references\n",
    "- Handle comments without affecting parsing\n",
    "- Process multi-line constructs properly\n",
    "- Flag all 10 edge cases appropriately\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- All syntax follows Base SAS standards\n",
    "- Files are designed to be syntactically valid but may reference non-existent resources\n",
    "- The test focuses on parsing accuracy, not execution validity\n",
    "- Comments are strategically placed to test parsing robustness\n"
